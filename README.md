# ElizaApp

The entire app is just to see the new Eliza on Facebook.... You can't access it directly because FB are lame and won't clear it for public use. You can however set up your own Private version. If you like heres a guide https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart/ you'll only need to follow up to step 4. Remember to add your APP ID into the fb_send_message.

Here's a video..... I made a while back
